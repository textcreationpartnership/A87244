            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Mr. Speaker,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>ON Frday la≈øt <hi>Dromannagh</hi> was ≈øurrendred into my hands, having fir≈øt made a ≈ømall breach in their Outwork, and falling on with ≈øome men; upon that the rebels retreated into the Ca≈øtle, which indeed was a place that might have held out a long time: but having gained the Town-wall, and drawn up our Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance again≈øt it, the rogues took quarter for life and wearing apparel onely, and left all things el≈øe, which were not valuable, they having long expected a ≈øiege: ≈øo as the be≈øt booty there was 4 barrels of powder, with a proportion of match, a ≈ømal piece of Ordnance, a Murderer, 2 ≈øling-pieces, and 100 Arms (but the gard were not above 60 men at mo≈øt). From thence I ≈øent away the Hor≈øe in≈øtantly to face <hi>Cappoquin,</hi> and ju≈øt as they drew up before the town, there was a ≈øupply of powder and match coming, with three Troops of Hor≈øe, and a Regiment of Foot, who pre≈øently retrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with all the ha≈øt they could to <hi>Clomnell</hi> in ≈øight of our Hor≈øe; ≈øo as when I came with the re≈øt of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to beleager the place; they conde≈øcended at the fir≈øt ≈øummons to treat, and (as afterwards appeared for want of Ammunition) to give up the place upon the inclo≈øed Articles: Ju≈øt as the town was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up to mee, I had adverti≈øment of the landing of Col. <hi>Temple,</hi> with upwards of 300 Hor≈øe; whereupon I cau≈øed the Army to be brought into <hi>Cappoquin;</hi> and the adjacent villages, where they might have ≈øome ≈øhelter from the weather, which hath been very foul,

I repaired unto <hi>Cork,</hi> to take order for fitting the new armed forces to come unto the Army, intending with them to ≈øit down before <hi>Dungarvan;</hi> and for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe I am fain fir≈øt to lead away the Army, with all things they are able to carry with them, and having fixed them to bring back the oxen and draught hor≈øes to draw the pieces of battery, all the oxen I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to draw no more then two of them at a time. And although I may happen by this means in two or three dayes to get the Ordnance from <hi>Cappoquin,</hi> to <hi>Dungarven,</hi> which is but 7 miles; yet I a≈ø≈øure you it wil be impo≈ø≈øible to draw them to any other place till we have draught-hor≈øes and carriages, the want whereof doth exceedingly ob≈øtruct the carrying on of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Upon the fir≈øt news of Col. <hi>Temple</hi> his coming, I was in great fear that the men come with him would be unwilling to come abroad, becau≈øe I had then no money left, but what was that day to be i≈ø≈øued to the Army in the field, who were paid partly in mony, and partly in provi≈øion; ≈øo as I had no ≈øhift, but to put the Army off two or three dayes for the money, and to give ≈øo much of that (as I found requi≈øite) to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh out Colonel <hi>Temples</hi> men; who had not been here 24 hours, when there arrived <hi>Richard Smith</hi> with the <hi>Robert</hi> and <hi>John</hi> of London with 1400 barrels of pea≈øe, and 700 barrels of wheat; and the next morning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I came to Cork, Capt. <hi>Swanly</hi> the Admiral of the≈øe Seas arrived with 5000 l. in mony, 140 hor≈øe, and 100 foot; ≈øo as now we are in probability ab≈øolutely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters of the field: And I doubt not, if our ≈øins do not render us yet unfit for ≈øuch mercies, that by the latter end of this Summer all this Province will be reduced; which will be much the better and ≈øooner done, if the
